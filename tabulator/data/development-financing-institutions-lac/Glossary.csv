Basic Information,,
Code,"Code is a unique ID for each PDB and DFI, which consists of ISO (alpha +Establishment Year (4 digits) +Number (two digits if there are more than 10 PDBs/DFIs in some countries)","1. ISO refers to Country ISO Code (alpha-2) if it is a national or subnational PDB or DFI; ""MB"" is used to refer to multinational PDBs and DFIs. According to the UN standard, see https://unece.org/trade/cefact/unlocode-code-list-country-and-territory https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/Country-Code.                       
2. Number here refers to the numbering of PDBs and DFIs if there is more than one national or subnational PDB and DFI established in the same year in the same country, or more than one multinational PDB and DFI established in the same year."
PDB&DFI Name,Name of PDB&DFI in convention,"Refer to the name as ""official"" as possible; use English official names if available; keep the name in original non-English language if it is widely used"
Name in original language,Name of PDB&DFI in original language,Refer to official names from official website.
Acronym,Acronym of the name of PDB&DFI ,"Refer to annual reports, official websites for the acronym; if not available from official sources, use the initial letter of each word in the English name."
Establishment Year,The calendar year when the PDB/DFI's articles of agreements were officially approved or signed (instead of the year when the PDB/DFI started its operation); use the establishment year of the parent institution if there is restructuring (even though the name or business models may be changed after restructuring),"1. Search the Articles of Agreement and find the year when the Articles of Agreement were signed;
2. Search the history in the official website to find the ""earliest"" year of the establishment, i.e., if a PDB or DFI is founded at certain year X but restructured in year Y, we record X as the establishment year."
Official Mandate,The official mandate stands for the mission to fulfill a particular public policy that a PDB or DFI is mandated to carry out. ,"We first classify the official mandates into flexible or not. Flexible (FLEX) means that official mandates are not confined to a specific mission. If they are not flexible, we further classify them by specific sectors or clients, including rural and agricultural development (AGRI), mainly promoting exports, foreign trade, but also includes other activities such as overseas investment (EXIM), social housing (HOUS), infrastructure (INFRA), international financing of private sector development (INTL), local government (LOCAL), and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSME). "
Geographical scope of ownership,,
Country,Name of the country/economy that owns the PDB or DFI,"If it is owned by more than two countries/economies, use ""Multi""."
Levels of Ownership,"According to their ownership structure, PDBs and DFIs are classified into three categories: multinational, national, and subnational. Multinational, initiated and owned by entities from more than two countries; national, created and owned by a central government (or national public entities), or private sectors in rare cases; and subnational, established and owned by a local government entity or jointly by several local governments. 
 
 ","If a PDB or DFI is set up by two central governments, we classify it as national, since under these circumstances it is easy to identify which country is the majority shareholder. Even if the two countries’ shares are 50/50, we can use other indicators such as the headquarters, main customers, and operators to determine which country of the two is the “main character”."
Geographical scope of operations,,
Subnational,"Dummy variable, which denotes whether the PDB/DFI's main activities are restricted within specific subnational areas. If it is restricted, then it is ""subnational""; If not, then ""national"".","For any single PDB or DFI, international and regional are marked as mutually exclusive, as an institution that can operate internationally can, by definition, also operate in its own geographical region. This is also applied to subnational versus national."
National,,
Types of Institutions,,
Guarantee Fund,choose 1 if the PDB/DFI is mainly engaged in offering guarantees,Use the PDB/DFI's claim on whether it 'mainly' or 'primarily' provides guarantees
Equity Fund,choose 1 if the PDB/DFI is mainly engaged in offering equity investments,Use the PDB/DFI's claim on whether it 'mainly' or 'primarily' provides equity investments
Size Category,"We use total assets as a criterion to classify PDBs and DFIs into five size categories: mega (more than $500 billion), large (between $100 billion and $500 billion [included]), medium (between $20 billion and $100 billion [included]), small (from $500 million to $20 billion [included]), and micro (less than and equal to $500 million).","The classification is based on total assets in the year of 2023; if not available, the data on total assets in previous years (2016-2022) is used. "
