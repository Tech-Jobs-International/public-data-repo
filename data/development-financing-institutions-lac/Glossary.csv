Search the Articles of Agreement and find the year when the Articles of Agreement were signed;
2. Search the history in the official website to find the ""earliest"" year of the establishment, i.e., if a Developnment Bank is founded at certain year X but restructured in year Y, we record X as the establishment year."
Official Mandate,The official mandate stands for the mission to fulfill a particular public policy that a Developnment Bank is mandated to carry out. ,"We first classify the official mandates into flexible or not. Flexible (FLEX) means that official mandates are not confined to a specific mission. If they are not flexible, we further classify them by specific sectors or clients, including rural and agricultural development (AGRI), mainly promoting exports, foreign trade, but also includes other activities such as overseas investment (EXIM), social housing (HOUS), infrastructure (INFRA), international financing of private sector development (INTL), local government (LOCAL), and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSME). "
Country,Name of the country/economy that owns the Developnment Bank,"If it is owned by more than two countries/economies, use ""Multi""."
Levels of Ownership,"According to their ownership structure, Developnment Banks are classified into three categories: multinational, national, and subnational. Multinational, initiated and owned by entities from more than two countries; national, created and owned by a central government (or national public entities), or private sectors in rare cases; and subnational, established and owned by a local government entity or jointly by several local governments. 
 
 ","If the bankl is set up by two central governments, we classify it as national, since under these circumstances it is easy to identify which country is the majority shareholder. Even if the two countries’ shares are 50/50, we can use other indicators such as the headquarters, main customers, and operators to determine which country of the two is the “main character”."
Geographical scope of operations,,
Subnational,"Dummy variable, which denotes whether the banks main activities are restricted within specific subnational areas. If it is restricted, then it is ""subnational""; If not, then ""national"".","For any single Developnment Bank, international and regional are marked as mutually exclusive, as an institution that can operate internationally can, by definition, also operate in its own geographical region. This is also applied to subnational versus national."
